    <h1>Week 6 - Blocks, procs and lambdas</h1>
    <h4>2015/7/5</h4>
    <p>Here is a brief, basic introduction to the concept of closures in Ruby.  Closures are simply a programming concept where you create a method in such a way that when you can call it from a different part of your program, it retains its original scope.  For example, it still has access to the variables in its original environment.  Some of the ways Ruby provides support for closures are blocks, <span class="code">proc</span>s, and <span class="code">lambda</span>s.</p>

    <p>A block is a chunk of code between {}brackets. The {}bracketed part of a <span class="code">#each</span> or <span class="code">#map</span> call, as in <span class="code">array.each { |item| puts item }</span>, is an example of a block.  Blocks can be called from elsewhere in the program, typically with the <span class="code">yield</span> method.    Blocks can only be used as part of a call to a method, unlike a <span class="code">proc</span>.</p>

    <p>A <span class="code">proc</span> (short for "procedure") is essentially a block wrapped up in an object.  A <span class="code">proc</span> object is an instance of the <span class="code">Proc</span> class.  Because it is an object, it has a name and can be passed around like any other variable.  It can also receive messages. </p>

    <p>A <span class="code">lambda</span> is a specialized <span class="code">proc</span>; a <span class="code">lambda</span> object is even an instance of the <span class="code">Proc</span> class.  There are a number of differences that generally make <span class="code">lambda</span>s more restrictive than <span class="code">proc</span>s. For example, <span class="code">proc</span>s don't care how many arguments you send it, while <span class="code">lambda</span>s complain if you send the wrong number.  Also, the <span class="code">return</span> keyword is treated differently–in a <span class="code">lambda</span>, <span class="code">return</span> sends the scope right outside of the brackets, while a <span class="code">proc</span> exits the entire method on <span class="code">return</span>.</p>

    <p>For more information on blocks, <span class="code">proc</span>s and <span class="code">lambda</span>s, check out <a href="http://awaxman11.github.io/blog/2013/08/05/what-is-the-difference-between-a-block/">this really helpful article</a>–it ended up being my primary source for this blog post.  Chapter 14 of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Well-Grounded-Rubyist-David-Black/dp/1617291692">The Well-Grounded Rubyist</a>, (2nd edition) is also dedicated to the topic.  <a href="https://rubymonk.com/learning/books/4-ruby-primer-ascent/chapters/18-blocks/lessons/64-blocks-procs-lambdas">RubyMonk</a> and <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/courses/ruby-beginner-en-L3ZCI/0/1">Codecademy</a> both include it in their curriculum.  Finally, <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/Proc.html">here's a link to the official <span class="code">Proc</span> Object documentation</a>.</p>
