      <h1>Week 3 - Hashes and Arrays</h1>
      <h4>2015/6/24</h4>
      <p>
        In programming, you frequently need a way to keep certain items grouped together when you store them away or pass them around.  In Ruby, you do this with hashes and arrays.
      </p>

      <p>
        Arrays are data structures that can store a collection of items.  In Ruby those items can be strings, integers, other arrays, a whole lot of other objects, or any combination thereof.  Arrays keep their items in a set order, and they can be accessed by their number in that order, starting with 0.  So if I have an array with a circle, a square and a triangle in it, it might look like this: shapes = [circle, square, triangle].  If I ask the <span class="code">shapes</span> array to give me its item 0, it gives me the circle.  Conversely, if I ever want the circe, I can access by calling shapes[0]; it's always the first item in the list. By default, arrays set their items in the order they were added, but they can easily be sorted using simple, built-in Ruby methods.
      </p>

      <p>
        Hashes are similar to arrays in that they are data structures that contain a collection of items, but unlike arrays they are not numerically indexed.  In theory they are also different in that hashes are unordered, but in practice a number of built-in Ruby methods make them almost as easy to alphabetize as arrays.  While arrays store single items and index them by order, hashes store key-value pair items.  For example, here's an array: <span class="code block_quote">capitals = ['Albany', 'Sacramento', 'Austin']</span>
        and here's a hash: <span class="code block_quote"> capitals = {'New York' => 'Albany', 'California' => 'Sacramento', 'Texas' => 'Austin'}</span>
        The capitals can be retrieved from the array by using its index number in brackets, for example: <span class="code">capitals[1]</span> will return 'Sacramento' (Albany is 0, remember).  The capitals can also be retrieved from the hash using bracket notation, but instead of using their order, the value is retrieved by providing the key.  For example: <span class="code">capitals['California']</span> will return <span class="code">Sacramento</span>.
