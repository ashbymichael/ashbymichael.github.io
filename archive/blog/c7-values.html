      <h1>Week 7 - Values</h1>
      <h4>2015/7/12</h4>
      <p>It's important to know what your values are <i>before</i> they're tested.  Here are a few of the values I aspire to, and why I think they're worthwhile.</p>

      <p><em>Fairness</em>, I think, is the most important of my values.  It is the best, most direct way I know to figure out the difference between right and wrong.  It's a basic value, applicable to many different situations, and easily testable by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule">golden</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_Rule">silver</a> rules.</p>

      <p><em>Teamwork</em> and <em>Independence</em>.  At first, they seem like really different values–almost mutually exclusive values.  But to me they are related and separately achievable goals, not opposite ends of a spectrum.  My ideal working environment is one with a strong sense of teamwork, where every member feels a sense of responsibility to each other and to the team.  This is the kind of team where I can be driven not to let my team down, and always know if another team member needs help.  The independence aspect is that I want to trust my team to do what they need to do, and I want them to trust me to provide what I need to provide.  (It's a very POODR-compatible philosophy.) Earning that trust–earning that independence–is my most important responsibility.</p>
