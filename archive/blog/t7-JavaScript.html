    <h1>Week 7 - Looping in Javascript</h1>
    <h4>2015/7/12</h4>

      <p>Ruby makes looping through collections (i.e. hashes and arrays) simple with its myriad built-in methods, but Javascript makes you work a little harder.  Let's look at how they differ.</p>

      <p>While Ruby offers at least half a dozen different options to cycle through various kinds of collections–and several variations on each–Javascript offers just two keywords for looping: <span class="code"> while</span> and <span class="code">for</span>. <span class="code">while</span> is the more basic of the two, accepting only one argument: a stop condition.  For example, the expression <span class="code">while ( x <= 10 ) { ... }</span> would execute the code inside the braces, check the value of x and, if it is less than or equal to 10, execute the code block again.  If the code block never causes x to be greater than 10, your program will enter an infinite loop.</p>

      <p>The <span class="code">for</span> keyword offers essentially the same functionality as <span class="code">while</span>, but it makes a couple of common tasks easier.  First is easy to create an infinite loop when using <span class="code">while</span>, and the primary purpose of <span class="code">for</span> is to make it easier to create an iterator. The code <span class="code">for (i = 0; i < 10; i++ ) { ... }</span> will execute the code in the block continuously until it reaches 10, but unlike a simple <span class="code">while</span> loop, you have considerable control over when it stops.  The other use of <span class="code">for</span> is as an enumerator function similar to Ruby's <span class="code">.each</span> function.  It uses the following syntax: <span class="code">for ( n in numbers ) { ... }</span>.</p>
