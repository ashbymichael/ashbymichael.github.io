      <h1>Week 9 - Questions</h1>
      <h4>2015/7/26</h4>
      <p>So far, all of my questions have been so basic that I could find the answer with about five minutes of Google research.  In this post, I will share what I've learned about finding the information I need on the web.</p>

      <p><em>Ruby-doc</em> - <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/">the official and best resource for Ruby information</a>.  I had to gain a fair bit of familiarity with Ruby before I found it really useful, but now it gives me exactly the information I need–what a method does, what arguments it takes, and what exactly it spits out.</p>

      <p><em>w3schools</em> - <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/">great resource</a> for information that can be easily referenced, for example–valid CSS attributes, or whether that jQuery method was getElementBy... or getElementsBy...  They also offer several tutorials, a sandbox for testing code, and a few other resources, but it's greatest value is as a kind of quick-reference cheat-sheet.</p>

      <p><em>Javascript</em> - Javascript is one of the most widely-used languages in the world, and there are no shortage of resources, tutorials and references.  The best reference is <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference">Mozilla's</a>, though it can be even more dense and intimidating than ruby-docs.  <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/">W3 Schools</a> has a pretty good Javascript reference library as well, and it's considerably easier to read.</p>

      <p><em>Google</em> - Google search tips are well-documented, and because I enjoy browsing blogs and learning about them, here are a few that taught me something new just now:
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://support.google.com/websearch#topic=3081620">Google's own help page</a> is surprisingly easy to overlook, but there's a lot of useful information here, particularly under the "Filter and refine your results" section.</li>
          <li><a href="http://libguides.mit.edu/c.php?g=176061&p=1159432">Here's a fantastic guide for power users from MIT</a>  Did you know that including the '~' operator in a Google search will include all synonyms of a word in a search?  For example, "Ruby ~tutorial" will return results for ruby tutorial, ruby guide, ruby help, etc...  This site is pretty thorough.</li>
          <li>If all you want is a quick dive into the best Google tips, try <a href="http://www.lifehack.org/articles/technology/20-tips-use-google-search-efficiently.html">this lifehack.org article</a></li>
        </ul></p>
