      <h1>CSS Positioning</h1>
      <h4>2015-5-31</h4>

      <p>The CSS <span class="code">position</span> attribute lets you control where and how the browser places the element in question.  The position attribute has four values: <span class="code">static</span>, <span class="code">relative</span>, <span class="code">absolute</span> and <span class="code">fixed</span>.</p>

      <p>These values are key to laying out your pages using CSS.  Below, I will explain and illustrate each of them.   The examples all use the following html:
      <br><img src="../imgs/html.png"></p>


      <p><span class="code">static</span> is the default setting.  This value displays each box-level element on a new line.  See the sample CSS and its output below. (Note that I included the "positon: static;" line for illustration purposes; as the default setting it is not necessary to include this line.)
      <br><img src="../imgs/static_css.png"><img src="../imgs/static_site.png"></p>

      <p>The <span class="code">relative</span> value lets you offset an element relative to where it would normally have been placed.  When you use this <span class="code">position</span>, you must supply one or two of the following additional attributes: <span class="code">top</span> or <span class="code">bottom</span>, and <span class="code">left</span> or <span class="code">right</span>.  The item in question will be offset <i>away from</i> that direction by whatever distance you give it (in <span class="code">px</span> or <span class="code">em</span>).   This more easily shown in an example than explained in words.  It is also important to note that other items on the page will not be moved; they will be arranged around the space the <span class="code">relative</span> item would occupy if it were <span class="code">static</span>.</p>

      <p>In the example below,  making the green square <span class="code">relative</span> and setting <span class="code">top</span> to 5em moves it down (<i>away from</i> the top).  Notice how the red and blue squares do not move.
      <br><img src="../imgs/relative_css1.png"><img src="../imgs/relative_site1.png"></p>

      <p>And in this example,  setting <span class="code">nottom</span> to 5em moves it up (<i>away from</i> the bottom):
      <br><img src="../imgs/relative_css2.png"><img src="../imgs/relative_site2.png"></p>

      <p>The <span class="code">absolute</span> value pulls the element out of the normal flow, and its location is set relative to its container with the <span class="code">top</span>, <span class="code">bottom</span>, <span class="code">left</span> and <span class="code">right</span> attributes.</p>

      <p>In the example below, I have set the green square to  <span class="code">absolute</span> , and put it 3<span class="code">em</span> away from the top and right sides of the container element (in this case, the <span class="code">&lt;html&gt;</span> tag).  Notice that it is pulled out of the original flow completely, and the red square slides up as if the green square weren't in the code at all.
      <br><img src="../imgs/absolute_css.png"><img src="../imgs/absolute_site.png"></p>


      <p>The <span class="code">fixed</span> value is similar to <span class="code">absolute</span> in that the value is not part of the normal flow of elements, but where <span class="code">absolute</span> sets the elements position relative to its containing element, <span class="code">fixed</span> sets its' position based on the browser window.  The effect is that when you scroll through the page, the <span class="code">fixed</span> element will not move.</p>

      <p>This is particularly useful for creating headers that "stick" to the top of the page, like so:
      <br><img src="../imgs/fixed_css.png">
      <br><img src="../imgs/fixed_site1.png"><img src="../imgs/fixed_site2.png"></p>
