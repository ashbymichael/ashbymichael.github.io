        My "Gregorc thinking styles" are abstract sequential and concrete random, tied.  According to a chart, abstract sequential means that I love experimenting; concrete random means I love reason and abstract thought.

        I agree with this.  Of course, like a fortune cookie, the other options seem pretty agreeable as well, so I'm not giving it much weight in making study plans.  My study plans, by the way, are as simple as they can be: study.  That's been my plan for a long time–it has served me well, and I like it. I've had a long time to develop my box of study tools, though, so in the interest of sharing, I'd like to explain one idea that works for me.  It may or may not work for you, or it may or may not be your style. For example, I'll admit that my study methods are grossly time-inefficient, and should never be applied to a subject you don't enjoy. Just keep in mind that this advice comes with a really big take-it-or-leave-it disclaimer.

        Since I started preparing to attend a bootcamp a few months ago, I've really tried to think of studying coding as learning a skill, rather than studying or researching a topic. If I'm trying to learn a new skill–e.g., playing a musical instrument, math, learning a language (my old specialty), taking up a new sport, or in this case, learning to program–it's fundamentally different than collecting and studying a list of facts as in, say, a research project.  When I study Ruby problems, I never do the problem only once.   I do it, wait a couple of days until I can't quite remember the solution, and then I do it when it's hard again.  I think of it as practicing, the same way I would a musical instrument or a sport.
      </p>

        Keep in mind that you get absolutely zero benefit from solving a coding exercise.  The value is entirely in learning <i>how</i> to solve the problem.

        I hope someone out there finds that helpful.  Happy studying, everybody!
