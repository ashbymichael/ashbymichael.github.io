    <h1>Week 5 - Ruby Classes</h1>
    <h4>2015/6/22</h4>
    <p>
      In Ruby, you can use classes to model real-world things and concepts.  For example, you may want to model users when building a web app, so that they can create accounts, log in/out, etc... A typical <span class="code">Users</span> class might look something like this:
    </p>
    <p class="code_block">
      Class Users
      <br>&nbsp;def initialize(username, email, password)
      <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;@username = username
      <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;@email = email
      <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;@password = password
      <br>&nbsp;end
      <br>&nbsp;attr_accessor :username, :email, :password
      <br>end
    </p>
    <p>
      The code above creates a <span class="code">Users</span> class and gives it three attributes, a username, an email, and a password. (In an actual web application, this is not good practice for storing passwords.  It's fine for explanatory purposes, though.)  It also uses attribute accessors to allow you to read and change the attributes.  The variables that begin with an "@" are instance variables, meaning that they are unique to each instance of <span class="code">Users</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
      From this <span class="code">Users</span> class, we can create as many instances as we want.  Each instance represents a user, and has its own @username, @email and @password values.  Thanks to <span class="code">attr_accessor</span>, we can check these values at any time using dot notation, for example: <span class="code">user_1.username #=> "Muttons"</span>.  We can assign the attributes new values (seemingly) just like any other value, for example: <span class="code">user_1.username = "Mittens"</span>.
    </p>
