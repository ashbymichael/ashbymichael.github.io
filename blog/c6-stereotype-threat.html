        Stereotype threat is a proposed contributing factor to some of the stubbornly persistent racial and gender gaps in academic performance and professional compensation. I have little to say about the stereotype threat hypothesis itself, but the larger issue is hugely important.  I did some reading on the topic, and would like to share a few interesting articles I found.

        First up, here are a couple of articles on 'unconscious bias', another aspect of the same issue.  This <a href="http://fortune.com/2015/01/15/how-corporate-america-is-tackling-unconscious-bias/">Fortune magazine article</a> from January (2015) discusses some of the ways corporations are working to increase diversity. It's a good introduction to to how human resources departments see this issue.  <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2014/09/25/unconscious-bias-is-why-we-dont-have-a-diverse-workplace-says/">This Engadget article</a> from September of last year (2014) covers a lot of the same ground, but is specifically focused on Google.

        Age bias is another discrimination issue particularly prevalent in the tech industry that has received considerable media attention over the past few years.  Here is a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/17/your-money/older-job-seekers-finds-ways-to-avoid-age-bias.html?_r=0">New York Times article</a> on the issue, one from <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/business/bottomline/article/In-Silicon-Valley-age-can-be-a-curse-4742365.php">SFGate</a>, and one more from <a href="http://fortune.com/2015/05/04/digital-native-employers-bias/">Fortune</a>. <a href="http://career-advice.monster.com/in-the-office/workplace-issues/avoid-age-bias-in-the-workplace/article.aspx">This Monster article</a> provides advice on employee protections against age bias.

        Diversity in tech remains an existentially important issue, but it's getting a little better all the time (it can't get no worse).
