          Coming into Dev Bootcamp, I feel confident in my preparation.  I looked up
          what was on Dev Bootcamp's curriculum (Ruby, Rails, Javascript, SQL) and I
          started preparing as early as I could, so I feel like I'm off to a good
          start on that foot.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the other hand, of course there are aspects that I can't really
          <em>prepare</em> for–Just how intense is the onsite portion?  How will I
          do when I don't have as much time as I want to study as I want?  What do I
          do when I don't know what to do?  But I signed up for a crazy experience,
          and now I just have to try to be ready for it.

          At the top of the video, Shereef mentions the two fear that students
          commonly have: that they either won't be good enough, or that their
          partner won't be as good as them.  When I started looking into coding
          bootcamps, I was definitely in the first camp–I don't have a CS background
          or credentials, and this can be a dense and esoteric field.  However, I
          think I've done an acceptable job of channeling that anxiety into action,
          and I hope I can keep the momentum.
        </p>
        <p>
          One final note on the video's main message, regarding kitchen and table
          mentalities: I've experienced this phenomenon quite a bit from the
          other side as an EFL/ESL teacher.  I had many students who were
          perfectly intelligent and motivated to learn, but they didn't seem to
          get how to perform their role as student.  I tried reminding them
          that, however much I might want to, and no matter how much money they
          paid, I couldn't <em>give</em> them a second language.  Ultimately,
          learning is something you have to <em>do</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now we'll see if I can apply what I learned as a teacher to my own
          performance as a student.
