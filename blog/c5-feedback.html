      <p>
        Working with other students is the aspect of Dev Bootcamp I have been most excited about.  It really is possible to cover a lot of the Phase 0 material on your own, but the pairing sessions are an experience you can only get by joining a group.  So far, I haven't had a single bad pairing session, but that isn't to say that there haven't been challenges.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before I get to the challenges, I'd like to discuss why it is such a valuable experience.  Collaborating with another person requires you to listen and understand your partner's ideas well enough to incorporate them into your code.  In turn, you have to be able to explain (and in some cases, sell) your ideas to your partner.  This is all in addition to having to solve the problem!
      </p>
      <p>
        And that leads to the biggest challenge.  As much as I enjoy working with people, so far I have found that I am a much, much better programmer when I work by myself.  There is a certain state of mind, at a certain level of focus, where I am able to hold on to all of the moving parts, remember what all the variables do–I can recreate the whole Rube Goldberg machine in my mind.  But I can't get to that place while I'm interacting with another person.  Even beyond how difficult it is to concentrate that deeply while another person is waiting on you, it seems to involve completely separate and mutually exclusive parts of the brain.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, to get the most out of my pairing sessions, I have found that the best stratgy is to always come prepared.  It's sort of a fine line–I don't want to actually solve the problem, but I want to have looked at it and thought it through ahead of time.  I especially try to be aware of anything that I know will trip me up–complicated loop-within-loop structures, methods that I am not that familiar with, etc...–and have resources and examples ready to go.  That way I can focus on communicating with my partner, and not on tracking down bugs.
